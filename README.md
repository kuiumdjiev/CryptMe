# Crypt-
CryptМе offers a method for concealing data within video files by combining steganography with cryptography. A distinctive aspect of this approach is the encryption of metadata (such as the file size, CRC, and markers) before embedding them into the video—a method that, based on current research, is not commonly implemented in existing solutions.
